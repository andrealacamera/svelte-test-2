# SVELTE-TEST-2

## Contents

The project extends the [SVELTE-TEST-1](https://github.com/andrealacamera/svelte-test-1), a mere introduction to Svelte and SvelteKit. 

Some additions:
- i18n by using `typesafe-i18n` library (see below)
- very preliminar tests on `TypeScript`.


## i18n

The blog article (see references) implements [typesafe-i18n](https://github.com/ivanhofer/typesafe-i18n) library. Not sure whether it's my piece of cake...

Moreover it seems that SSG (static site generation woth prerender option) doesn't work...

Further readings are necessary, but when the project will be complete!.

## TBD

- Waiting for the 3rd part of the blog article to finish this work...
- Try other libs for i18n!!!
- Implement menu (burger in mobile), carousel with some "card" (title, text, link, bg-image), animation (`Anime.js`?) -> Maybe in the next `svelte-test-n`?

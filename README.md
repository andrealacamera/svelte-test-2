# SVELTE-TEST-2

## Contents

The project extends the previous project, a mere introduction to Svelte and SvelteKit. 

Some additions:
- i18n (see below)
- very preliminar tests on TypeScript.


## i18n

The blog article implements [this lib](https://github.com/ivanhofer/typesafe-i18n). Not sure whether it's my piece of cake...
## TBD

- [] Waiting for the 3rd part of the article to finish my work
- [] Test several other lib for i18n!!!
- [] Implement menu (burger in mobile), carousel with some "card" (title, text, link, bg-image), animation (`Anime.js`?)
